This is a program that helps a viable company user or
company admin connect to the system. The company has a 
database designed by me which required the need for a 
user friendly system to help the users of the database
to connect to the database, retrieve information, delete
unnecessary data, update information, input new data and
other necessary operations as desired by the users.
The system has been made user friendly to suite user needs.
The company is a warehouse company which sells its goods
to customers or other retailers. It deals with soft drinks
from various other companies. Their database takes sales 
and purchase information as well as information relating
to other transactions and stores it. From here, the system
can then be used to query the database and generate 
information that can be used in desicion making by the 
board of directors. 
The system has a user login page that enables users to login
into the system where they can do all sorts of operations.
The database specifies a list of users who can access the 
system along with their ranks. This list is used to counter
check the given information to see if the user is viable or
not. If the user is not viable, he/she cannot login into the
system. A bunch of other buttons appear on th user login
form and are pretty easy to use.
